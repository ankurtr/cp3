programming excercies from cp3 book

Currently I'm reading and practising an interesting book https://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Programming-3rd-Steven-Halim/dp/B00FG8MNN8

This project contains all the excercise and code that is required for each chapter of the book..

Everything is coded in Java.
